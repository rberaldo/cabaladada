title: Harder, better, faster, stronger
author: Rafael Beraldo
excerpt: In which I talk about how the blog was rebooted, what’s new and the technology I'm using to write it. I also explain the role of the Business Cat in Cabaladadá’s recent history.

Last month or so I deleted everything I had posted on Cabaladadá so far. For
more than a month, Business Cat gave the good news to every visitor.

tonight. We really have to catch that red dot.")

I finally took a deep breath and decided to start working on the blog again.
This is the “final” result. It’ll probably change over the years to come but
this is a good starting point for someone who can barely code in CSS.

I wanted to make Cabaladadá more personal. It was too brainy, too serious. I
couldn’t write because every time I tried to, it felt overwhelmingly painful. I
realized I was trying to rewrite Goethe’s&nbsp;_Faust_ every time I opened vim
and I needed a fresh start. Now I can start having fun again (I hope).

There was something else annoying me. [WordPress][wordpress]. But don’t get me
wrong: I love WordPress, and I really recommend it if you’re new to blogging and
wants something that is robust and customizable. It just wasn’t the right tool
for me. The upgrades were distressing and, lately, something would often break.
Also, my netbook isn’t very powerful, so the admin interface itself was too
CPU-consuming.

And then I remembered of jekyll. [dudektria][dudektria] introduced me to
[jekyll][jekyll] a long time ago. He later would recommend [nanoc][nanoc] over
jekyll but, I don’t know exactly why, I decided to go with the first one.  Maybe
because I had already installed it on my computer.

jekyll is beautiful. It is simple, I can write my posts in markdown and it
converts them automatically to HTML, and I don’t need a fancy administration web
interface. I can write plain text files using vim, and then upload a static
website to my server. I can use git to keep track of changes. It is [blogging
the hacker way][preston], and I love it.

It’s exactly what I wanted. Oh, and did I mention it’s written in Ruby?

Another decision that I had taken several months ago was that Cabaladadá should
be in English. I probably read more English than Portuguese these days but I
don’t get enough writing. Blogging is a great way to correct this. I may
eventually publish in Portuguese or translate a few articles, but Cabaladadá
will be mostly in Douglas Adams’ language.

Finally, I hope you like the terminal theme. It isn’t perfect yet—maybe the font
is too big or too small depending on your browser—but I think it is simple and
reflects this new phase of Cabaladadá: more hackerish, still nerdy, a bit
technical, and certainly discordian.
