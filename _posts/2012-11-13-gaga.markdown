This is the story of how I ended up going to a Lady Gaga concert.

Many years ago, a good Discordian friend introduced me to a crazy little girl
by the name of Amanda. By that time, round the year of 2008, I was even
cockier than I am today and she was a goth. No need to say we didn't get along.

Then time went by, as it often does. It was early 2012, and I found myself
drunk, after hanging out with another good friend, annoying people on some
social network. Amanda was unlucky enough to be waken. We talked about Japanese
grammar, a subject I know next to nil, but we had a good time. Being a Big
Monster, that is, a Lovecraft fan, I sent her a few short stories written by
the master of horror.

A few days after that, I instant messaged her asking whether she'd enjoyed
Lovecraft. We've spoken every single day since then.

We started dating on April 11, which was also the very first day I saw her in
real life. Amanda lives more than a thousand kilometers away, which is
oftentimes hard but we get by. We're two strong penguins.

Amanda and I have had much fun; we've drunk lots of good beer and wine,
listened to great music and laid out plans together. She's truly an amazing
girlfriend. She gets me and shares the same dreams. Besides, she mastered the
art of ignoring my really bad jokes!

When the opportunity of going to a Lady Gaga concert came about, I promptly
accepted to go with her, even though my entire life I believed pop music wasn't
my kind of music. I really thank her for inviting me to go: the concert was
amazing. Gosh, there was a giant Gothic castle that opened to reveal the
drummer and guitar player! I was also surprised to find that Lady Gaga is not
only an accomplished performer but also an extremely good singer that, under
all the makeup and fancy clothing, cares about her fans.

I had never been to a concert of those proportions but that's just how life is:
full of unexpected journeys. When the year began, I had now idea what was in
store for me, and it couldn't be better.

Thank you, Amanda, and may we be forever young!
