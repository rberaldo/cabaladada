  <p>These are a few of my projects.</p>

  <h2>LaTeX workshops</h2>
  <p>I've been invited to teach <a href="https://github.com/rberaldo/workshop-latex-scielo">LaTeX workshops at SciELO</a> and <a href="https://github.com/opensanca/workshop-latex">opensanca</a>. These experiences were great and I'm looking forward to the next ones.</p>

  <h2>sancaLUG</h2>
  <p>Since September 2016, I've been part of <a href="https://sancalug.org/">sancaLUG</a>, a Linux User Group in São Carlos area. We've organized some installfests, talk nights, and celebrations like Arduino Day and the Software Freedom Day.</a>

  <h2><em>Contos Discordianos</em></h2>
  <p><em>Contos Discordianos</em> is a discordian book of short stories. You can grab a copy at <a href="http://www.bookess.com/read/8255-contos-discordianos/readers/">Bookess</a> or download the source code from <a href="https://github.com/rberaldo/Contos-Discordianos">GitHub</a>. It was typeset using the amazing LaTeX!</p>

  <h2>Repositório de Letras</h2>
  <p>In order to help my fellow students of Literature and Linguistics, I set up a website with a number of classic texts in PDF. They’re texts you’re likely to read in college.</p>

  <p>Go to <a href="http://letras.cabaladada.org/">letras.cabaladada.org</a> to enjoy this little collection of texts.</p>

  <h2>Labs in Brazil</h2>
