  <p>Hello, I’m Rafael Beraldo.</p>

  <p>I have a degree in Linguistics and English at <a href="http://fclar.unesp.br/">UNESP</a>. Currently, I’m an English language tutor in Brazil, but increasingly involved with the free software community. Since September 2016, I've been <a href="https://sancalug.org/">running a Linux User Group in São Carlos</a>.</p>

  <p>You can get <a href="/public/cv-rberaldo.pdf">a copy of my CV here</a> (in Portuguese).</p>

  <h2>About this blog</h2>

  <p>This is Cabaladadá version 3.0.</p>

  <p>Cabaladadá is my first and only blog to take off. It was influenced from the very beginning by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism">Discordian Philosophy</a>. In fact, “<em>cabala</em>”, or “cabal”, in English, is a kind of group within discordianism; and “dada” comes from “dadaism”, the artistic movement with roots in early 20th century Europe.</p>
